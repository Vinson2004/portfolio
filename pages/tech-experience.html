     <p class="box">I don't have much experience in technology or coding. The only real 
        tech/coding experience I have is my personal project that I work on 
        for my computer engineering class. I decided to build and program an 
        LED shoe containing 6 different alternating patterns all powered by an 
        Arduino Nano. This project involved circuit building and programming 
        through the Arduino IDE software, which has functions and elements from 
        C++. I was very proud that I was able to complete this project 
        successfully. Overall, I am very eager to learn more about coding 
        in this course as I think it will be a very beneficial and important 
        skill going into the future!</p>
